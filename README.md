# Unity Project Test - Generic Version

Welcome to the documentation of my Unity project test! This is a generic version of a test project I completed for a job role. Below is a description of each specialized README in this directory. I've anonymized the project to focus on the technical aspects and functionalities I implemented.

## Getting Started
Each README is provided within its respective directory and contains in-depth information about the component it documents. This will facilitate a better understanding of the project's features and how they can be discussed or utilized in other contexts.

## [Global Data & Editor Tools README](Assets/GenericProject/1.GlobalData/README.md)
Here you'll find documentation on a robust system designed to handle global data through ScriptableObjects. These are designed to be universally accessible at runtime and are also easily managed within the Unity editor. The README also covers editor tools that can manipulate and filter GameObjects, making extensive use of the global data provided.

## [Dial Control and Interaction System README](Assets/GenericProject/3.AdvancedInteraction/README.md)
This component outlines a flexible Dial Control system for Unity. It includes a detailed guide on how to create dial controls that are responsive and customizable, with a variety of position and value settings. While the current implementation is based on the Unity Input System, it is designed to be adaptable for different types of inputs, beyond mouse controls.

## [Network Interaction System README](Assets/GenericProject/5.Multiplayer/README.md)
The network interaction system facilitates multiplayer experiences by ensuring smooth and synchronized interactions across the network. This document provides insight into the setup and management of networked objects for real-time collaboration or competition.

I appreciate the opportunity to showcase the skills and knowledge applied in this test project. Looking forward to our next conversation!
